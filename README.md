Module 1 Name Scrapper - scraps a baby names website to collect all the names in the world and its country of origin or ethinicity
  The names are already scrapped and the raw csv has been already given. so no need to bother scrapping

Module 2 Cleaning Scrapped Data - gives few codes to make basic cleaning of the scrapped data

Module 3 Name Origin Finder using soft NLP - provides codes and a function using Levenshtein Distance to calculate the differences between sequences to find the origins of the names provided by making a fuzzy search of names between the names provided and scrapped database

Module 4 Name Comparer by Column - helps in basic code in comparing names between columns by spelling consistency
